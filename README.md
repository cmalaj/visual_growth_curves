# Growth Curve Visualisation Portal

This web-based tool allows users to upload and visualise 96-well plate growth curve data directly from `.txt` files generated by plate readers. It supports interactive time-series plots and heatmaps, enabling quick assessment of experimental results.

## Features

- Upload one or more `.txt` files for batch analysis
- Generate time-series plots with colour-coded wells
- View heatmaps summarising OD600 values at the final timepoint
- Toggle visibility by row and column (e.g., all row A wells)
- Streamlit-powered â€” no installation required to use online

## Usage

### Online Portal

You can use the app directly at:

https://mfkpcsfphsy3leemfksxae.streamlit.app

1. Upload one or more `.txt` files
2. Review interactive time-series and heatmaps
3. Use dropdowns to toggle rows/columns for focused viewing
4. Right-click or use the chart menu to export any plot as PNG

### Run Locally

    git clone https://github.com/cmalaj/visual_growth_curves.git
    cd visual_growth_curves
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    streamlit run growth_curve_portal.py

## File Format

The app expects input files to contain:

- A metadata block at the top
- A data block with:
  - A `Well` column (e.g., `A1`, `B12`)
  - A `Time` column (minutes)
  - One or more OD600 measurement columns

Example snippet:

    Well    Time    OD600
    A1      0       0.05
    A1      15      0.08
    ...

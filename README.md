# Growth Curve Visualisation Portal

This web-based tool allows users to upload and visualise 96-well plate growth curve data directly from `.txt` files generated by plate readers. It supports interactive time-series plots and heatmaps, enabling quick assessment of experimental results.

## Features

- Upload one or more `.txt` files for batch analysis
- Generate time-series plots with colour-coded wells
- View heatmaps summarising OD600 values at the final timepoint
- Toggle visibility by row and column (e.g., all row A wells)
- Streamlit-powered â€” no installation required to use online
